# Fluid Notebook README

The goal of this extension is to provide a seamless node.js notebook experience.

Initially, it is based on the observable parser and runtime and integrates with the forthcoming VSCode native notebook support.

## Features

- [x] Run node js code
- [ ] Mix python and node in one notebook
- [ ] Show DOM outputs

## Requirements

Currently, you must use the nightly / Insiders build of VSCode as the API is not yet available for marketplace extensions.

## Extension Settings

Include if your extension adds any VS Code settings through the `contributes.configuration` extension point.

For example:

This extension contributes the following settings:

- `myExtension.enable`: enable/disable this extension
- `myExtension.thing`: set to `blah` to do something

## Known Issues

Basically doesn't work yeto!
